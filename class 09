# Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

1- What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 

2- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects

3- What are the benefits of a pure function?
One of the major benefits of using pure functions is they are immediately testable. 


4- What is immutability?
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.


5- What is Referential transparency?
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

 a standard or unit of measurement

2- What does the word ‘require’ do?
to claim or ask for by right and authority
